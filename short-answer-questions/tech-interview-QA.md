#### 1. `Final` keyword:
- If the final keyword is added on a string, like a final String name is “jack”, the name can not be changed to Bob. 
- If the final keyword is added for the object type, like a final List is already initialized using new ArrayList<>(), the content in this list can be changed, but the list can not be initialized by using a new keyword again. 
- If the final keyword is added to the method of a class, it will not be overridden in the subclass of this class. 
- If the final keyword is added to a class, it will not be extended.
